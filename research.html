    <b>Ecogeomorphology</b> is the study of the interactions between organisms and landscapes. I'm particularly interested in salt marshes like the one to the left. If you look closely at the photo (click for a better view), you'll see a scarp on top of which is a marsh plant from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartina"><i>Spartina</i></a> genus and below which is an unvegetated flat. The presence of the vegetation on the marsh platform reinforces the sediment and makes it more resistant to erosion. Furthermore, biomass produced above- and belowground by <i>Spartina</i> is incorporated into the platform and raises its elevation. So when sea level rises, the marsh doesn't just sit around and wait for the sea to drown it: it actively builds itself up. This means that marshes can withstand moderate rates of sea-level rise simply by accreting.

    This and many, many more interactions between biology and geomorphology are what make landscapes so complex and interesting.
