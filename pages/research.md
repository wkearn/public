## The structure of discharge in salt marsh creeks

An example of a one month long record of stage (water level) and discharge (water flow) from a salt marsh creek is shown in the figure. There is clearly some complex structure in this relationship. It varies over time as the tides run through their spring-neap cycle. But there seems to be a pattern the way the discharge bends as the tide rises and falls. This behavior reflects the flow processes going on in the marsh, but how, exactly, is the geometry of this time series generated? Can we exploit the geometric properties of the stage-discharge relationship to learn something about the structure of the marsh?

## Network geometry of arid coastal marshes

Lining both coasts of the Gulf of California are hypersaline lagoons called esteros. These esteros harbor salt-marsh-like ecosystems, but in some of them, the water is so salty that vegetation cannot grow on the surface of the marsh. We showed in Kearney and Fagherazzi ([2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12287)) that these unvegetated marsh platforms have very different channel networks than vegetated marshes. The estero channel networks are more heavily branched, and their channels are straighter than those of vegetated salt marshes. We believe that this difference is generated by the lack of vegetation which otherwise would support the marsh banks and allow meandering channels to develop. The difference in network geometry has the potential to change the way water transports nutrients and sediment into the estero and therefore the biological structure of the estero, however we don't have yet good data from these esteros to examine this hypothesis
