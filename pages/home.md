I am a PhD student in the [Department of Earth and Environment](http://www.bu.edu/earth/) at Boston University. I work with [Sergio Fagherazzi](http://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/sergio-fagherazzi/) to study how fundamental physical processes like the flow of water and the transport of sediments and nutrients lead to large-scale patterns in wetland ecosystems. I particularly like to use tools from statistics, signal processing, and dynamical systems theory to interpret data from environmental sensors in terms of the structure and functioning of wetlands.
