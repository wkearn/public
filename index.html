    I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/earth/">Department of Earth and Environment</a> at Boston University. I work with <a href="http://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/sergio-fagherazzi/">Sergio Fagherazzi</a> on coastal ecogeomorphology, the study of the interactions between biology and coastal landscapes. I apply a combination of field work, remote sensing, and numerical modeling to solve problems ranging from tidal network geometry to ecological succession.
